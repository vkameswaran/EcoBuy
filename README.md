# EcoBuy: Sustainable Shopping Tracker

Our team created an application that tackles the issue of plastic and package waste, by educating users on which products include unnecessary amounts of packaging.

EcoBuy is an application that helps users become more environmentally friendly by encouraging them to buy products that use minimal amounts of packaging. Our product allows you to visualize and become aware of how eco-friendly you are by calculating the sustainability index â€“ the average amount of packaging across all items you purchased at a grocery store. Key features include:

- The application color codes every item you purchase based on the sustainability factor, from red as not eco-friendly to green as eco-friendly.
- The application allows you to track your progress by viewing the scores of your previous grocery trips as well as giving information on the most eco-friendly products you purchased and their brands;

We hope EcoBuy will help you limit your packaging waste and become more eco-friendly.
